### Details
I have only included the front-end code I wrote. 

My main focus was using Bootstrap 3 with ASP.Net to create mobile-first and/or mobile friendly web pages. 

You will not find any: 
- Logins (mine were deactivate after I left the company)
- Visual Studio solution files
- VB backend programming code
- Database connections

This was an enterprise-level year long project created to make it easier for the drivers to view their settlement sheets on their smart phones and tablets. 

I was given design specs from the marketing department's graphic designer in the form of printed out page designs. 

Since the graphic designer didn't know any code. It was my job to translate the pages handed to me into valid web pages. 

I found that ASP.Net controls do not respond at all to CSS.

I eventually ended up using a special ASP.Net attribute for adding CSS classes to ASP.Net tags. As well as Themes and Skin files to create the dynamically changing themes for the site based on which kind of driver was logged in. 

I am thankful to the developers who taught me a lot while working on this project.
